# Hidden Teleporters
A simple Hytale server mod that hides teleporter icons on the map and changes the
teleporter interaction user interface to have a text input instead of a dropdown box to prevent players from
seeing other target warps.

This is useful for PvP servers where players want to hide their portals or use secret codes for their portals.
